# ubiSOM2023
Complementary materials and source code to the examples provided in the book chapter "Exploratory Cluster Analysis using Self-Organizing Maps"


# Java Neural Networks Framework

Available in a separate github site <https://github.com/brunomnsilva/UbiquitousNeuralNetworks>. In addition to the codebase, the GitHub repository also provides a wiki <https://github.com/brunomnsilva/UbiquitousNeuralNetworks/wiki> that serves as a comprehensive guide to using the library. The wiki includes detailed explanations on how to use the library effectively. It also provides examples and tutorials, making it a valuable resource for both newcomers to self-organizing maps and experienced users looking to deepen their understanding.

# MultiSOM Processing Sketch and Libraries

The files in this folder are the following:

  - wine.csv - A normalised copy of the Wine dataset <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/109/wine>.
  - ubiSOM2.jar - The second edition of the ubiSOM library. The ubiSOM library was already published and presented in [Silva,2016].
  - multiSOM_PDE - The processing PDE folder containing the processing example and data for using the multiSOM library. The multiSOM library was already published and presented in [MarquesSantosSilva2016].
 - results - Folder with the output files for the results presented in the chapter.

The source code for examples and for some of the Libraries is available with the free MIT Licence. Complete source code is under development, but available for research purposes. Please contact the authors if you are interested in helping to develop this project.
